## Future additions

### Things that still need to be done manually

1. Install all the apps that aren't yet in this setup (see below).
2. Set trackpad tracking rate.
3. Set mouse tracking rate.
4. Sync VSCode Settings via Gist.
5. Configure extra Mail and/or Calendar accounts (e.g. Google, Exchange, etc.).

### Applications/packages to be added

These are mostly direct download links, some are more difficult to install because of custom installers or other nonstandard install quirks:

- [Adobe Creative Cloud](http://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html)
- [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)

### Configuration to be added
...
